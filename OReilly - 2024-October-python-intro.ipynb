    "When computers were first invented, each computer could solve one problem. If you wanted to change the problem it was solving, you needed to rework the computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "People then came up with the idea of a general-purpose computer, one that could be used to solve many different problems. We could specify how we want to solve the problem by giving it instructions in binary code (1s and 0s). \n",
    "\n",
    "People then came up with the idea of a higher-level programming language, one that is closer to human language, but which is then translated into 1s and 0s.  There are hundreds of thousands of programming languages today, each of which works a little differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Some are designed to be very high level, closer to how humans think/write\n",
    "- Some are very low level, designed to be closer to how computers work\n",
    "- Some run very fast, some very slow\n",
    "- Some are good at graphics\n",
    "- Some are good at using very little memory\n",
    "- Some are good at designing chips\n",
    "\n",
    "You've probably heard of a bunch of them:\n",
    "- C (low level, runs very fast, and is very efficient)\n",
    "- C++ (a little higher level than C, also runs very fast and is very efficient -- and very complex)\n",
    "- Java (a lot higher level than C++, runs (now) very fast)\n",
    "- bash/zsh for shell scripts (it only is meant to be used in certain areas, and runs very slowly, but is great at working with files and directories)\n",
    "- Python (very high level, doesn't run super fast, but is meant to be readable)\n",
    "\n",
    "It's not that hard to write software! But you will spend most of your time debugging, editing, and changing software. If it's readable, then you'll have an easier time doing that.\n",
